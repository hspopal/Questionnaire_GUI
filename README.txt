This is a program that will be used by my lab to administer behavioral questionnaires regarding Autism Spectrum Disorders. The researcher will navigate through the GUI for the subject entering in information like their subject ID and which questionnaires they would like the subject to do. Then the subject can fill out the electronic questionnaires independently.


DIRECTIONS:

1. Use terminal to run the 'RUN_PROGRAM.py' script.

2. On the first page, enter a subject ID number, then click ‘save’, and then ‘continue’.

3. On the next page, select which questionnaires you wish to complete, then click ‘save’, and then ‘continue’.

4. On the third page, click ‘open’ to bring up the first questionnaire.

5. After filling out responses, click ‘save responses’ and close the window. The next questionnaire will be brought up automatically.

6. Once you are done with all questionnaires, click ‘quit’ on the main console.




Responses from the questionnaires will be stored in each questionnaire’s
respective directory, and named as the respective questionnaire
(ie. 'IRI.csv' under questionnaires/IRI/)
